# Movie Finder App

A mobile app built with Expo, React Native, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that helps users search for movies with an extensive search feature. It ranks movies based on popularity using real-time data fetched via Appwrite and displays them in a modern, responsive UI.

The project focuses on clean code architecture, performance, and a smooth user experience.
